# Code of Conduct

REMEMBER - this is a free project you use - the maintainers are not here to look into a crystal ball or take any form of abuse.  This is not a product, it is something that is given away for free.

* Be respectful
* Be concise by providing as much information as possible such as code samples, FULL stack traces, etc - stating that you've followed docs/samples/etc is just not good enough
* Reply to questions back from the maintainer if you want your issue resolved
* Issues are only taken for the latest STABLE version of the library - preview versions of the library can be discussed on the SponsorConnect Discord channel available to sponsors only
* Just because you have an issue, doesn't mean it will be fixed right away.  The maintainer isn't a developer for your project.  Using reasoning such as "critical, time sensitive, etc" is not fair to the developers of this project.  Don't do it and be respectful
* Issues that contain "Mono.Linker.MarkException: Error processing method: '*****' in assembly" are something you need to learn to setup in your release versions.  You need to read the documentation from Microsoft here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/cross-platform/deploy-test/linker
* DO NOT REQUEST TIMELINES - the answer every single time will be "when it's done"!  Refer to very first note above
* We do not take the Sat4.NET samples repository for issues.  Why you might ask?  A number of reasons
    * They aren't always up-to-date with the latest version of Sat4.NET, .NET, etc
    * They are setup for debugging or as general guidelines for users
* No requests will be taken for the following
    * Library Updates
    * Documentation Updates
    * Samples
    * Support for libraries not listed in the product selection
    * Timelines
